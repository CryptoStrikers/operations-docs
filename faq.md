# CryptoStrikers FAQ

## Understanding CryptoStrikers

**What is CryptoStrikers?**

CryptoStrikers is a new type of digital trading game that allows you to collect, trade, and win rare sports card collectibles. Each player card is 100% owned by you; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.

**How do I play CryptoStrikers?**

The objective of CryptoStrikers is to fully complete collections of the 2 sets of cards available - the Originals and the Iconics. If you complete either (i) one or (ii) both of the collections by the end of July 20, 2018, you will be earn awards.

The Original and Iconics cards can be purchased in packs of 4, individually through the Marketplace, or via trades with other users. The complete sets consist of 100 Originals and 32 Iconics cards. 

Iconics cards cannot be bought in self-contained packs, but they will be available via Premium Sale inserts starting on June 14, 2018. 24 of the 32 Iconics cards will be available on a rotating daily basis; the other 8 Iconics cards can be acquired via earning Referral Program awards or through the Marketplace.

Packs of cards will no longer be available for purchase starting on July 16, 2018. Users will be able to continue to buy and sell cards from the Marketplace at that time.

**Does it cost money to play CryptoStrikers?**

Yes. Someone can send you a player card as a gift, but otherwise each player card is available for purchase using the digital currency Ether (ETH).

**How many CryptoStrikers do I need to get started?**

You’re officially in the game with one. However, we recommend starting with buying a pack to start building your collection.

**What’s the big deal about CryptoStrikers?**

CryptoStrikers is one of the world’s first games to be built on the Ethereum blockchain. You can buy, sell, or trade your CryptoStrikers cards like traditional collectibles, fully confident that the blockchain will track ownership securely. All transactions and operations relating to the game are verifiable.

Blockchain technology enables the creation of cryptocollectibles like CryptoStrikers cards that address issues with traditional trading card systems:

* True Digital Ownership: Your ownership, and transfer of any cryptocollectible, is transparent and traceable via the Ethereum blockchain.
* Provable Scarcity: Supply and rarity are enforced by an immutable, decentralized ledger, not by a central party that can create new items at will.
* Trustless Trading: Cryptocollectibles are managed by smart contracts and not a central company. Since the cryptocollectibles are transferrable by nature, they can be exchanged outside of closed ecosystems, thus increasing liquidity with others globally.
* Extensibility: The CryptoStrikers cards live beyond the CryptoStrikers website. They can be traded on other marketplaces or in other applications that are built. You can send your cards to whomever you wish, play or exchange them whenever you want, and view at any time anywhere..

**What is the CryptoStrikers mission statement?**

To bring the value of blockchain technology to consumers in ways that unlock new experiences, redefine the meaning of digital ownership, and support the participation of all stakeholders in a decentralized global ecosystem.

## Getting started

**What do I need to play CryptoStrikers?**

To get started, you need the following:

(1) Either (i) a computer or laptop running the desktop version of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Brave; or (ii) a mobile phone installed with the iOS or Android app for Toshi, Cipher Browser, or Trust Wallet
(2) The MetaMask digital wallet or compatible digital wallet
(3) Ether, the form of digital payment accepted on CryptoStrikers

**Installing MetaMask, your digital wallet**

We can only distribute card packs to wallets created on MetaMask (and a few other applications - see our guide below). Exchange wallets such as Coinbase or Binance can not be used with CryptoStrikers.

Your digital wallet acts as your login to the CryptoStrikers application. You will need to transfer Ether to your MetaMask digital wallet in order to make any purchases.

**_Note:_** The MetaMask wallet acts like a bank account—treat it with respect and make sure you don’t forget your password or the seed words. CryptoStrikers cannot restore your account if you lose your credentials.

Here is a [step-by-step guide](https://medium.com/cryptostrikers/getting-started-how-to-install-metamask-4a2d9c18b4cc) to install MetaMask. If video is more your thing, click the image below to watch a video.

**Why is MetaMask locked?**

MetaMask automatically locks your account after a certain period of time. To unlock MetaMask, simply click on the MetaMask extension and type in your password.

**Reinstalling MetaMask**

If you need to reinstall the MetaMask browser extension on your computer or tablet, delete the extension, reinstall it, and import your twelve seed words. You’ll then set the password you want to use (this can be the same one you used before or a whole new password), and confirm your email address and username again on the CryptoStrikers website.

**What’s ether (ETH)? Why do I need it to play CryptoStrikers?**

Ether powers the Ethereum network, which is what CryptoStrikers is built on. Ether acts like any other currency, and its value fluctuates with the market.

You need to convert your currency (e.g. USD, CAD, GBP, etc.) into Ether to pay for player cards and other items available through our application.

**Getting Ether**

**_For U.S. citizens only:_** From the CryptoStrikers web app, you can buy Ether (ETH) in MetaMask. ETH is the digital currency that enables CryptoStrikers to operate. Users who are accessing CryptoStrikers from a mobile wallet, or do not wish to use the Coinbase widget from the MetaMask browser extension, will need to purchase ETH as described below.

![Image Alt Text](https://github.com/CryptoStrikers/operations-docs/blob/master/images/metamask-eth.png)

**_For everyone else:_** You will need to purchase ETH from an exchange, and then transfer the ETH from your exchange wallet to your MetaMask wallet. Unfortunately, you cannot play CryptoStrikers with only an exchange account.

You cannot use USD/CAD to purchase player cards on CryptoStrikers—currencies need to be converted into ETH first.

**How to send ETH to MetaMask**

For U.S. citizens only: From the CryptoStrikers web app, you are able to purchase ETH directly from the MetaMask wallet using the Coinbase widget. This process does not require you to create another account; ETH you purchase will appear in your balance on MetaMask. Users who are accessing CryptoStrikers from a mobile wallet, or do not wish to use the Coinbase widget from the MetaMask browser extension, will need to transfer ETH to their MetaMask account as described below.

For everyone else: You need to buy ETH from an exchange using normal fiat currency. Copy your MetaMask address by clicking on the copy icon‘’ next to your account. Go to your exchange, click ‘Accounts’, and select your ETH Wallet and click ‘send’. Paste the MetaMask address in the box with the amount you’d like to transfer.

**What is ‘gas’?**

‘Gas’ is a shorthand used to describe the cost of powering a transaction or contract in Ethereum, which is the blockchain network that CryptoStrikers is built on.

Because the blockchain is decentralized, and not powered via a central server, every transaction needs to be verified through a process called ‘mining’. This process ensures each token—in this case, each CryptoStrikers card—is secure. However, verifying transactions requires computational power - gas costs are fees used to compensate individuals for computational processing. 

Gas costs are typically expressed in gwei (1 million gwei = 1 ether/ETH). 

For a more detailed explanation, please read this [overview](https://ethgas.io).

**When do I need to pay ‘gas’?**

You must pay gas for any transaction that is recorded on the blockchain. In the context of this game, such transactions include, but are not limited to: buying cards, selling cards, gifting cards, and claiming prizes.

**Why is it so complicated to get started with CryptoStrikers?**

CryptoStrikers is built on blockchain technology, which is relatively new technology. Tools for users are still in their infancy. The technology platform is safe and secure, but it’s going to be a little complicated until tools are created to make it easier to build easy-to-use consumer experiences.

## Buying and selling

**How do I buy CryptoStrikers cards?**

Cards can be bought in packs of 4 by going to the ‘Buy Cards’ link. Cards can be bought individually by going to the ‘Marketplace’ and purchasing cards directly from other users.

**What are the different type of card packs offered for purchase?**

‘Original’ set cards can be bought via Standard packs using Ether (‘Normal Sale’) or through exchanging a CryptoKitty (‘Exchange Sale’). Iconics cards are available via inserts in ‘Premium’ pack purchases with Ether (‘Premium Sale’). Iconics cards are available on a limited time basis - 1 day max only - and their schedule is announced daily starting on June 14, 2018.

**How do I find out which Iconics card is available in a Premium Sale?**

Check the Buy Packs page often or keep any eye out for announcements via email, and our social accounts, [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptostrikers), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/7CSBBBb).

**How do I sell CryptoStrikers cards?**

Go to the My Club page and click one of the cards that you own. There will be a button to ‘Sell’ your card on the Card Detail page. 

**Can I list multiple cards in a single sale offer?**

No, we do not support that functionality at this time.

How much does it cost to buy a CryptoStrikers pack or card?
Standard packs are priced in the ETH equivalent of US$15/pack, while Premium packs are priced in the ETH equivalent of US$30/pack

There’s no standard price for an individual card. Users set their own selling price when they sell a given card.

**Are there any limitations on buying a pack with a CryptoKitty?**

There are 1,000 packs that may be bought with a CryptoKitty. No such sales will be allowed once this supply runs out. Each user is limited to one such purchase. Any owned CryptoKitty associated with your MetaMask wallet address may be used to make this purchase.

**What should I do if my card isn’t selling?**

Pricing for individual cards will be determined by supply and demand. If your card isn’t selling, you can reduce the sale price at any time or cancel the sale and wait to put the card back on market at a later date. Consider reviewing current market prices for player cards when determining what sale price to set. 

**What is the fee to sell my cards on CryptoStrikers?**

We do not take any fees from sales transactions on our marketplace. Note that it’s possible to do whatever you want with your card outside of our marketplace without paying us anything. If you do decide to sell your cards on marketplaces outside of CryptoStrikers, please check out any fees before creating a sale listing.

**Can I cancel a sale listing that I’ve created?**

Yes. To cancel a sale listing, go to your Activity Feed, locate the sale transaction you wish to cancel, then click ‘Cancel’ button next to the transaction. Creating a sale is a transaction on the blockchain, so you must pay gas to cancel the sale. Your card is only returned to you if your cancel order is processed prior to another user’s buy order being processed.

## Trading

**How do I create a trade offer?**

Go to the Trade Center. If you know the wallet address of your trading partner, enter it in the field provided. Pick a player card that you own and wish to trade. If you’ve entered your trading partner’s wallet info, you will be able to choose from one of the cards that user owns. If not, you can select one of the cards available in any collection that you wish to acquire. Once you click ‘submit’ and the transaction has been mined/recorded on the blockchain, your offer will be officially created.

**How do I share my trade offer with others?**

Once you ‘submit’ your trade offer, you will receive a ‘trade offer link’. You can then share this URL wherever and however you like - via email, text, social media posts, messenger apps, etc. When a prospective trading partner navigates to your trade offer URL, they will see your offer on a unique page and can accept it from that location.

**How can I find trading partners?**

You can post a message on our [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptostrikers) or our #trading channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7CSBBBb) to find trading partners. You can also contact people you know directly through whatever communication method you prefer.

**How do I accept a trade offer that I’ve received from another user?**

Click the trade offer link, and you will be directed to a unique page that will display the cards in the proposed trade. You can then click the ‘Accept’ button to execute the trade. 

**Can I cancel a trade offer that I’ve created?**

Yes. To cancel a trade offer, go to your Activity Feed, locate the trade offer you wish to cancel, then click ‘Cancel’ button next to the transaction. Creating a trade is a transaction on the blockchain, so you must pay gas to cancel the sale. Your card is only returned to you if your cancel order is processed prior to another user’s trade acceptance being processed.

**Why can’t I create trades with multiple players?**

That functionality is not set up in the initial release of CryptoStrikers. It is a feature that we’d like to offer in a future iteration of the game. (Do you have other ideas on features we should offer? Please contact us at feedback@cryptostrikers.com or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7CSBBBb) channel.)

## Other

**Are CryptoStrikers cards like Bitcoin?**

CryptoStrikers cards are not a cryptocurrency nor are they a token affiliated with an ICO. They’re what is commonly referred to as a ‘cryptocollectible’. The real-world analogy for a cryptocurrency is dollars or pounds; a cryptocollectible real world analogy is closer to assets like baseball cards.

As programmed and managed by smart contracts, any CryptoStrikers card that you own belongs to you. The price of any card is determined by market demand, scarcity, and your asking price.

**Why can’t I see my sale on Etherscan?**

Payments for sales are called “internal transactions” on Etherscan. These transactions are listed on their own tab.

**Is this a scam?**

No, this isn’t a scam. Our two person CryptoStrikers team is not allowed to directly participate in this game. We have also installed safeguards wherever possible to limit manipulation by bad actors.

**Can I use a Credit Card to play CryptoStrikers?**

No, the technology isn’t available yet to support credit card transactions.. However, most exchanges do let you buy Ether with a credit card.

**Can I play CryptoStrikers with my phone?**

Yes. While we have not launched a native mobile app at this time, you can play CryptoStrikers on a mobile phone via the Cipher Browser, Toshi, or Trust Wallet available on iOS or Android. Once you have set up an account on one of those services, use the mobile browser to navigate to www.cryptostrikers.com to play the game.
